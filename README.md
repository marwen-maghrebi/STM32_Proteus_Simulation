## Repository  Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `1-USART_Polling_IT_DMA_MODE/`: This project likely involves the implementation of USART (Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) communication using polling, interrupt, or DMA (Direct Memory Access) mode.
- `2-TIMER Periodic IT _Counter_Output Compare MODE/`: This project appears to involve the utilization of a TIMER module to generate periodic interrupts and perform counter and output compare operations.
- `3-TIMER One-Pulse_PWM_Input Capture MODE:/`:This project involves the utilization of a TIMER module in the One-Pulse PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) Input Capture mode. In this mode, the TIMER is configured to capture the duration of a one-pulse signal and perform specific actions based on the captured value.
- `4-ADC Polling_IT_DMA/`: This project likely focuses on the ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) module and its usage in either polling, interrupt-driven, or DMA mode.
- `5-Displays/`: This project  deals with different types of displays, such as LCD (Liquid Crystal Display).
- `6-SPI Polling IT DMA MODE/`: This project focuses on the utilization of the SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) module in various modes such as polling, interrupt-driven, and DMA (Direct Memory Access) mode.
- `7-SPI TC72 Temperature Sensor/`: This project focuses on the integration of an SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) module with the TC72 temperature sensor. The TC72 is a digital temperature sensor that communicates using the SPI protocol, providing accurate temperature measurements with high resolution.
- `8-SPI_MATRIX_7SEG/`: This project focuses on utilizing the SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) communication protocol to drive a matrix display or a 7-segment display
- `9-STM32 ST7735R/`: This project likely involves using an STM32 microcontroller in combination with the ST7735R TFT display module.
- `10-STM32 ILI9341 TFT/`: Similar to project 9, this project involves utilizing the STM32 microcontroller along with the ILI9341 TFT display module. 
- `11-STM32 PCP3008/`: This project might involve integrating the STM32 microcontroller with the PCP3008 chip. The PCP3008 is an 8-channel, 10-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that can be used to measure analog signals.
- `12-Traffic Intersection Controller/`:  involves designing and implementing a system using an STM32 microcontroller to control the traffic flow at an intersection.
- `13-STM32 Motors/`:  involves integrating STM32 microcontrollers with motor driver modules such as L289n and L293D. The microcontroller uses timers for precise motor control, ADC for sensor input, and USART for communication.
